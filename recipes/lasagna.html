      <li class="li">
        In a large pan, heat the olive oil over a low heat. Fry the onion,
        carrot, celery and garlic for 5 mins, or until softened. Add the mince
        and fry on a medium heat until golden. Turn up the heat, pour in the
        wine and bubble until reduced. Stir in the tomato purée, chopped
        tomatoes and stock. Add in the Worcestershire sauce and simmer for 15
        mins, or until the liquid has reduced. Season.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, make the white sauce. Melt the butter in a small saucepan
        over a low heat and add the flour. Whisk until combined and cook on low
        for 1-2 mins. Remove from the heat and gradually whisk in the milk until
        you have a loose sauce. Season. Return to a gentle heat and whisk
        constantly until the sauce thickens.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Layer up the lasagne in a
        baking dish, starting with a third each of the ragu, then the pasta,
        then the white sauce. Repeat twice. Top with the Parmesan and mozzarella
        then bake in the oven for 40-45 mins, until piping hot and crisp and
        bubbling on top. Serve immediately.

    <p><strong>Freezing and defrosting guidelines</strong></p>
    <p>
      Once the dish has cooled completely, transfer it to an airtight,
      freezer-safe container, seal and freeze for up to 1-3 months. To serve,
      defrost thoroughly in the fridge overnight before reheating. Loosely cover
      with foil and bake until dish is thoroughly heated through. Reheat until
      piping hot.
