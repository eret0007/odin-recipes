      Peel and rinse the potatoes. Then cut them into sticks by cutting the
      potato in 4 or 5 vertical pieces, and then cutting each piece into sticks.
      Place them in a large bowl and cover with cold water. Allow them to soak,
      2 to 3 hours. (You can also stick them in the fridge and let them soak
      overnight.) When you're ready to make the fries, drain off the water and
      lay the potatoes on 2 baking sheets lined with paper towels. Blot with
      paper towels to dry them. Heat a few inches of oil in a heavy pot to
      150°C. In 3 or 4 batches, cook the potatoes until soft, 4 to 5 minutes per
      batch. They should not be brown at this point! You just want to start the
      cooking process. Remove each batch and drain on new/dry paper towels. Once
      all the potatoes have been fried at 150°C, turn up the heat until the oil
      reaches 200°C. When the oil's hot, start frying the potatoes in batches
      again, cooking until the fries are golden and crisp. Remove the potatoes
      from the oil and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with sea salt and dive
      in!

      <strong> IMPORTANT</strong>: Please be careful when frying with hot oil.
      Keep the pot on the backburner so little kiddos won't get hurt.
